# Closed[In] Blog
### this is the source code for the Blogging Network Closed[In]

### Heads up
This is a relatively old project of mine and I don't work on it anymore - if I were, I would probably just start from scratch with Typescript.

### What is this?
This is basically a project I did to test out the capabilities of Next.js when using it for SSG (Static Site Generation).
So this is what the App does - It uses a Sanity headless CMS to generate Article Pages.

### Running on:
- Next.js (React.js)
- React-Markdown
- Katex
